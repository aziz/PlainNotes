Simple and pleasant authoring and note taking for SublimeText.

With PlainNotes you can:
- Organize notes and thoughts
- Maintain todo-lists
- Write documents
- and probably more

PlainNotes stores and organizes all your notes in a folder and make them accessible with a single shortcut or mouse click.
It also provides you with an enhanced version of Markdown markup and some good looking color schemes for note taking.
It's been designed with these ground rules in mind:
- Plain text is the holy grail
- Plain text shouldn't be that plain
- Simple and Sexy is Sublime

## Usage

**Note:** Although PlainNotes works under SublimeText 2, some features might not be available. We're not actively testing it 
under SublimeText 2 but will do our best to make it compatible and usable. We appreciate bug reports and pull requests. 

Most of PlainNotes commands are accessible from the SublimeText main menu. You should have a menu item called `Notes` right after `Help`. Although, there are faster and easier ways of running those commnads that are mentioned below.

#### Starting a new note (`super+F4`)
- **Command palette**: Open command palette and search for `Notes: new` command (typing `nn` will probably find it for you).
    + To save note in a subfolder of the root directory use `/`: `"subfolder name"/"note name"`.
- **Shortcut**: By default pressing <kbd>super+F4</kbd> will create a new note. For customizing the shortcut see [Keyboard Shortcuts]() section. 

#### Opening an existing note (`F4`)
- **Command palette**: Open command palette and search for `Notes: List…` command (typing `nl` will probably find it for you), the command will show the *Latest Notes quick panel* from which you can select or search for your file.   
The *Latest Notes quick panel* is sorting files based on their last-edit time, so the note that you have been working on recently should be on top of the list. 
- **Shortcut**: By default pressing <kbd>F4</kbd> will open the *Latest Notes quick panel*. For customizing the shortcut see [Keyboard Shortcuts]() section.

#### Jotter (`F1`)
Jotter will let you jot down your thoughts and ideas quickly without disturbing your work-flow. It opens a *Note Panel* at the bottom of the editor which is ready to take your note. When you press <kbd>ESC</kbd> it automatically closes the panel and saves your note with a time stamp in your *Inbox*. 

It can be accessed by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> (that can be customized in your Key-bindings if it conflicts with your other key-bindings) or through `Notes: Jotter` in command palette.
The default color scheme of the jotter panel can be customized in user settings (`Preferences -> Package Settings -> PlainNotes -> Settings - User`): 

```json
{ "jotter_color_scheme": "Packages/PlainNotes/Color Schemes/Sticky-Yellow.tmTheme" }
```

#### Inbox
Inbox is where all your quick notes from *Jotter* live. You can view inbox through `Notes: Inbox` in command palette or via the Notes main menu. 
The date and time format of the note headers in inbox can be customized in user settings (`Preferences -> Package Settings -> PlainNotes -> Settings - User`): 

```json
{
    "jotter_date_format": "%-d %-b %Y",
    "jotter_time_format": "%-I:%M %p"
}
```

#### Notes Index Card (`ctrl+F4`)
Pressing <kbd>ctrl+F4</kbd> or selecting `Notes: Index` from the command palette will give you the *Notes Index Card* with the list of all notes sorted alphabetically.  
Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> on any note will open it in a new tab.

 
#### Change note color
Open command palette and search for `Note: Change Color…`. it will give you a list of 10 different colors that is shown in the above image. Pressing up and down will give you a preview.  
Color of the note is remembered by PlainNotes and whenever you open that file, PlainNotes will set the color-scheme automatically.

#### Archive note
Open command palette and search for `Note: Archive`. This will move the note into an archive folder than can be specified in the settings -- The default archive directory is `.archive`. Archiving a note hides it from the Index and List.

#### Unarchive notes
Open command palette and search for `Note: Unarchive...`. This will open a list of archived notes sorted by modification date. Selecting one from the list will unarchive that note.

#### Delete note
Open a note and then open command palette and search for `Note: Delete`. 

#### Rename note
Open a note and then open command palette and search for `Note: Rename`. 

#### Change note file extension
You can change the note file extension in settings. To do so, go to `Preferences -> Package Settings -> PlainNotes -> Settings - User` and modify `"note_save_extension":`. The default note type is `.note` which has the possibility of setting different note colors and some special markup. Alternatively you can use any note extension you want such as markdown `.md`.

#### Add yaml front matter to notes
Go to `Preferences -> Package Settings -> PlainNotes -> Settings - User` and modify `"enable_yaml"`

By default, the following yaml items are added:
```yaml
title:
date:
tags:
```

To add more yaml items you can add them to the settings by modifying `note_yaml:`:

```json
{ "note_yaml" : ["categories"] }
```
